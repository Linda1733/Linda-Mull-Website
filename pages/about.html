      <h3>About Me</h3>
	  <hr>
      <div class="about">
        <div class="col-md-12">
			<p>In 2010, I enrolled at Harrisburg Area Community College to earn my Associate’s Degree in Web Development and Design.  At that time, I had spent 15 years working in local area legal firms and wanted a change of pace.  I always had an interest in computers, so I made the decision to pursue that course of study.  At the time, I didn't realize how much I would come to enjoy learning.  I had always loved to read, so I made the switch from recreational reading to technical reading.</p>
			<p>I worked full-time while attending classes at HACC part-time.  Each semester I earned a spot on the Dean’s List and I was invited to become a member of the Phi Theta Kappa, an Honor Society for two-year colleges.</p>
			<p>In February of 2013, I was hired at HACC as an assistant to the Webmaster to assist in a project for the revamping of their website.  It gave me the opportunity to become involved in the planning and implementation process for rolling out their new site, which was a great opportunity to learn how a reconstruction of a major website works.</p>
			<p>In December of 2013, Compworks hired me as an intern to participate in the development of a web application for a Pennsylvania state agency.  I wanted the various degrees of skill that both jobs offered, so I maintained my position at HACC.</p>
			<p>In March of 2014, Computer Aid, Inc., the parent company of Compworks, extended to me an offer of employment as a Business Analyst.  After graduation, I started my position with them and it has built upon my skills that I acquired at HACC.</p>
			<p>In September of 2014, I saw the need to further my education.  I enrolled in Elizabethtown College and I am currently working towards my Bachelor’s Degree in Management Information Systems.</p>
